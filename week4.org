that are individually contributed by members of a group or organization.

- Three revolutions leading up to the battle of the alamo
  - Spanish revolt against French occupation of Spain (1808)
  - Mexican revolt against Spanish occupation (September 15, 1810)
  - After Mexico finally gained freedom in 1821, Santa Anna led a revolt against
    rebel-turned-Mexican-emperor, Spanish general Agustin de Iturbide

- Places defenders (listed at the above link) from the alamo come from (and how
  many come from there)
| Alabama        |  1 | Arkansas              |  2 | Connecticut   |  1 |
| England        | 10 | Georgia               |  4 | Germany       |  2 |
| Illinois       |  1 | Ireland               | 10 | Kentucky*     | 15 |
| Louisiana      |  4 | Maryland              |  1 | Massachusetts |  4 |
| Mississippi    |  2 | Missouri              |  5 | New Hampshire |  1 |
| Ney York       |  6 | North Carolina        |  7 | Ohio          |  4 |
| Pennsylvania   | 15 | Rhode Island          |  1 | Scotland      |  4 |
| South Carolina |  7 | Spanish/Mexican Texas |  8 | Tennessee*    | 32 |
| Vermont        |  1 | Virginia*             | 14 |               |    |
- Notably, James Bowie is from Kentucky; William Travis is from South Carolina;
  Davy Crocket is from Tennessee.
- Just the defenders listed at thealamo.org is very diverse group of people. And
  three of those people, notably Bowie, Travis, and Crocket came from different
  places.
- Imagine that if the group had not been so diverse and only those from
  Spanish/Mexican Texas defended the Alamo, there would indeed be significantly
  less diversity, and Texas may be a very different place than it is today.
